If using 100% buckwheat soba, do not add salt to the cooking water; it can affect the texture and sturdiness of the noodle. Drain in cool water to remove gluten and starchiness. This helps the texture and prevents the soba noodles from getting gummy and gluey. Set aside.', 2, 95),

Add napa cabbage, shiitake mushrooms, carrot strips, and a sprinkle of salt. Stir constantly for 2-3 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger for 1-2 minutes.', 3, 95),

(570, 'Cut slits into the layer of fat that surrounds the pork loin. No need to cut slits into the non-fat portion. If your loins are thicker than 1 cm, tenderize with a meat mallet or with the back and side of your knife for tender pork.', 1, 96),
(571, 'Season on both sides with enough salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Prepare three shallow bowls. Add all-purpose flour into the first large bowl. In the second bowl, beat your eggs. In the third bowl, spread out the panko. Evenly coat each piece of pork into the flour first and shake off excess flour.', 2, 96),
(572, 'Then, evenly coat the pork in the beaten eggs. Lastly, generously coat the pork in panko – ensuring no bald spots. Repeat for the remaining loins.', 3, 96),
(573, 'In a large pan, heat oil over medium heat (350 degrees F). Check to see if the oil is hot enough by using an instant-read thermometer or place a wooden chopstick in the oil and look for bubbles.', 4, 96),
(574, 'Carefully lower pork away from you. Do not overcrowd the pan. Cook the pork in batches (no more than 2 pieces per batch). Deep-frying on each side for 2-3 minutes or evenly golden brown (or an internal temperature of 145 F).', 5, 96),
(575, 'Remove and transfer to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.', 6, 96),

(576, 'To a large bowl, add the first four dry ingredients for the bread dough—1¾ cups bread flour, 3½ Tbsp cake flour, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar. Whisk to combine.', 1, 97),
(577, 'Next, add 1¼ tsp instant yeast to the bowl and whisk to combine. Then, add 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell), beaten. Add 3 Tbsp whole milk and 3 Tbsp water, both at 86ºF (30ºC). Using a silicone spatula or your fingertips, gently mix the ingredients together until combined. Tip: I highly recommend using whole milk instead of reduced-fat milk.', 2, 97),
(578, 'In the beginning, the dough will feel very sticky and wet, but keep mixing until it forms a loose, sticky ball. This step should take about 2 minutes. Also, use the dough ball to pick up any flour on the sides of the mixing bowl. Transfer the dough from the bowl to a work surface lightly dusted with bread flour.', 3, 97),
(579, 'Knead: To knead the dough, press the heels of your hands into the dough, pushing forward slightly. Fold down the top half of the dough back toward you. Then, rock forward on the lower part of your palm to press it flat and away from you.', 4, 97),
(580, "Rotate the dough clockwise slightly, fold the dough down in half, and rock into it again with the lower part of your palm. Knead the dough to lengthen and stretch the gluten strands to make the dough more elastic. Repeat this rotate, fold, and knead process for 5 minutes or so. Tip: Lightly dust your hands with bread flour to keep the dough from sticking too much. If it's still too sticky to knead, sprinkle a tiny bit of bread flour on top and work it into the dough. Add only the minimum necessary to keep the dough from sticking to your hands, as adding too much flour will make the dough dry and hard. Aim for a moist, soft dough that is smooth and pliable and holds a ball shape.", 5, 97),
(581, "Add the Butter: After kneading for 5 minutes, the dough will get more elastic. Next, press and stretch the dough until it's a flat log about 10 inches (25 cm) long. Put the small cubes of 2½ Tbsp unsalted butter (at room temperature) all over the top of the dough. Roll up the dough, tucking in the butter. Then, continue to knead as before. Your hands, the dough, and the work surface will get greasy and messy in the beginning. Don't panic; the dough will eventually absorb the butter as you continue to knead. I recommend using a metal or silicone dough scraper once in a while to collect the dough stuck on the work surface. Keep kneading.", 6, 97),
(582, "Slam and Fold: Once the dough becomes very smooth and easy to work with, 'slam and fold' the dough to further develop its gluten (elasticity). First, hold one end of the dough and slam the other end onto the work surface. Bang! Next, fold the bottom end up and over away from you. Then, knead the dough with the lower part of your palm. Pick up the dough, turn it 90 degrees, then repeat this slam-and-fold process. Continue for 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, supple, and silky. Tip: Don't let go of the dough when you are banging it onto the work surface and don't let it rest for too long between turns.", 7, 97),  
(583, "The Windowpane Test: When the dough feels silky and smooth, it's time for the windowpane test to see if the dough's gluten is well developed. Either pull on a part of the dough or tear off a small piece. Hold the dough in both hands and gently pull it into a square with your fingers. It should be very elastic, smooth, and shiny. If it's strong enough to stretch to a super-thin membrane without tearing and light can pass through the center, your dough passes the test. If the dough tears easily or doesn't stretch, the gluten isn't quite ready yet. Knead it again for another 2 minutes and test again.", 8, 97),
(584, "Form the dough into a ball by pulling and tucking all edges toward the bottom and pinching them together. Place the dough in a bowl with the seam side down. Bulk Fermentation: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1–2 hours. I use the Proof setting (100ºF/38ºC) in my oven. Tip: If you live in a cooler environment and your oven doesn't have a Proof setting, place small baking dishes of boiling water at the four corners on the lower-middle rack. Then, place your dough in a bowl in the center of the rack and close the door. The steam and heat from the boiling water will create a warm environment for bulk fermentation. If you live in a warmer environment, you may not need to do this; your proof time also may be shorter", 9, 97),

(585, "In a pot over a portable electric or gas cooktop (or just your regular stove) over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons sake, ¼ cup mirin, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and ¼ cup soy sauce in a saucepan", 1, 98),
(586, "Bring to a boil, turn off the heat, make sure all the sugar is dissolved, and transfer to a bowl. Then prepare all your sukiyaki ingredients––the tofu slices, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage, tong ho, and scallions. Set aside on a plate. Soak the dried vermicelli noodles in water for 10 minutes.", 2, 98),
(587, "Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the pan. Fry the white parts of the scallions in the oil for 2 minutes. Chop the green parts of the scallions finely and set aside. In the pan with the scallions, add the thinly sliced beef. Sear the beef for 10 seconds, and add a drizzle of your sukiyaki sauce.", 3, 98),
(588, "Fry the meat until it just begins to brown––it should still be a bit pink. Remove from the pot and set aside. Add the rest of your sukiyaki sauce and 2 cups dashi stock. Bring to a boil.", 4, 98),
